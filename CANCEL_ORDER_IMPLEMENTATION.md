# Order Cancellation Implementation

## Overview
Users can now cancel orders when they are in pending state. This has been implemented throughout the application.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (Already Existed)
- ✅ **Cancel Order API Endpoint**: `PUT /api/orders/:id/cancel`
- ✅ **Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own orders (admins can cancel any)
- ✅ **Status Restrictions**: Only allows cancellation of non-shipped/non-delivered orders
- ✅ **Stock Restoration**: Automatically restores product stock when order is cancelled
- ✅ **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization checks

### Frontend (Newly Added)

#### OrderTracking Page (`client/src/pages/OrderTracking.js`)
- ✅ **Cancel Button**: Shows for orders with 'Pending' status
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Uses SweetAlert to confirm cancellation
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows "Cancelling..." while processing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Displays errors if cancellation fails
- ✅ **Success Feedback**: Shows success toast on successful cancellation
- ✅ **Auto Refresh**: Refreshes order list after cancellation
- ✅ **Timeline Update**: Shows cancelled status in order timeline

#### Profile Page (`client/src/pages/Profile.js`)
- ✅ **Cancel Button**: Shows for orders with 'Pending' status in order history
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Uses SweetAlert to confirm cancellation
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shows "Cancelling..." while processing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Displays errors if cancellation fails
- ✅ **Success Feedback**: Shows success toast on successful cancellation
- ✅ **Auto Refresh**: Refreshes order list after cancellation

## Technical Details

### API Function
```javascript
export async function cancelOrder(orderId, token) {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/orders/${orderId}/cancel`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  });
  return res.json();
}
```

### Backend Logic
1. Finds order by ID
2. Checks user ownership (unless admin)
3. Validates order status (cannot cancel shipped/delivered orders)
4. Restores product stock by incrementing quantities
5. Updates order status to 'Cancelled'
6. Returns updated order

### Frontend Implementation
1. Import `cancelOrder` from API service
2. Add state for tracking cancelling orders
3. Implement `handleCancelOrder` function with confirmation
4. Add cancel button that only shows for pending orders
5. Handle loading states and error feedback
6. Refresh order list after successful cancellation

## User Experience

### When Users Can Cancel
- ✅ Orders with status: **'Pending'**
- ✅ Orders with status: **'Confirmed'** 
- ✅ Orders with status: **'Processing'**
- ❌ Orders with status: **'Shipped'**
- ❌ Orders with status: **'Delivered'**
- ❌ Orders with status: **'Cancelled'** (already cancelled)

### What Happens When Cancelling
1. User clicks "Cancel Order" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears asking for confirmation
3. If confirmed, button shows "Cancelling..." state
4. API call is made to cancel the order
5. Product stock is restored automatically
6. Order status is updated to 'Cancelled'
7. Success message is shown to user
8. Order list is refreshed to show updated status

### Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed
- Server errors (e.g., order not found, unauthorized) are shown
- User-friendly error messages are displayed via SweetAlert

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `client/src/pages/OrderTracking.js` - Added cancel functionality
- `client/src/pages/Profile.js` - Added cancel functionality to order history
- `client/src/services/api.js` - Already had `cancelOrder` function

### Backend (No changes needed)
- `server/routes/orders.js` - Already had cancel route
- `server/controllers/orderController.js` - Already had cancel logic
- `server/models/Order.js` - Already had proper status enum

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Pending Order Cancellation**
   - Create a new order
   - Verify cancel button appears
   - Cancel the order and verify status updates

2. **Test Status Restrictions**
   - Try to cancel shipped/delivered orders (should fail)
   - Verify proper error messages are shown

3. **Test Stock Restoration**
   - Check product stock before/after cancellation
   - Verify stock is properly restored

4. **Test Authorization**
   - Try to cancel another user's order (should fail)
   - Test admin cancellation privileges

5. **Test UI Flow**
   - Verify cancel button only shows for pending orders
   - Test loading states and success/error messages
   - Verify order list refreshes properly

## Notes
- The backend implementation was already complete and secure
- Frontend implementation follows established patterns in the codebase
- Proper error handling and user feedback is implemented
- The feature integrates seamlessly with existing order management
